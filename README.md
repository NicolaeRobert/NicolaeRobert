## 🚀 About Me

Since I started programming, my main goal has been to **understand how the web works** and to become capable of building **real-world projects**.  
I began my journey with **Python**, a versatile language that opened the door to both web development and AI.  
From there, I explored **HTML** and **CSS** to understand frontend basics, then moved on to learning how **APIs**, **requests**, and **responses** work.  
I also completed a **MySQL** course to learn about databases, and most recently I’ve been learning **Git** and **GitHub** to collaborate effectively and manage projects.
